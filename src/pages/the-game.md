_if you‚Äôre wondering where the rest of the doc went, it‚Äôs in the other tab :)_

## OUTLINE\!\!\!\!\!

- post-apocalypse
  - You wake up in Random Hall omg
  - Mom has been dead for a while
  - You get curious abt humans
  - Accidentally stumble into mural
- Big Apocalypse
  - Wtf cuz all these rats are scary af
  - Get chased into a corner
  - Another cat saves u\!\!\! They are lvl 2000 and u r lvl 1 üòî
  - Interact w book/library mural (time travel) or Die
- LIBRARY
  - Blocked off: look at miro
  - Start at library (everything locked)
  - There are students that leave towards main group (where you get your sword\!), but green also gets unlocked
- Normal rats everywhere in peaceful past (more highly concentrated in tunnels) except library (you can attack to level up ur xp)
- MAIN GROUP
  - talking to npcs
  - kill normal rats
  - see normal urop posters
  - overhear some convos
  - ("rats aren't my thing")
- Time travel to future for a puzzle (unlock 30‚Äôs) and then back
- 30‚Äôs
  - One of the rats you kill begs for mercy
  - Start seeing more urop posters
  - Puzzle (but u also have to be a certain level) to unlock stata
- Stata (the main puzzle is just navigating the place)
  - Meet characters
    - ‚ÄúThe last ungraduated 6-1 left on earth‚Äù
      - They give u smth that greatly helps you?
    - Brainrot student majoring in 6-4
      - Addicted to cocomelon
  - Cafe where you can buy items?
  - Rubber room w/ rats (training area) (ratpocalypse time period)
  - Loading docks (gamble)
- 16/56/66 (‚Äúgood labs‚Äù)
  - Not rat experiments
  - Contributes to your sense of thinking ‚Äúthese researchers are so cool good yay\!\!‚Äù
  - Puzzle to unlock room
    - Inside you hear a bit of the bad stuff (regarding the rats), it doesn‚Äôt rly persuade you but it does make you more curious
  - UROP posters change to more demanding
- 13/24
  - Start in past, find out horrors
    - You have the choice to save a rat mid-experiment (but it comes at some high cost)
  - Go to future
    - IF CHOSE TO SAVE: You meet that rat you saved and they implore you to help them stop the experiments/save the rats
      - Rat gives you key
        - They had made/found the key bc they wanted to save their fellow rats but it was too late, the experiments had already finished and the superrats had gone rogue. They try to persuade you to go to the past and use the key to save the other rats before it‚Äôs too late
    - This is where routes really diverge. You either save the rats (for the past; in ratpocalypse, you have to kill the superrats bc they‚Äôre too far gone) or you exterminate the rats.
- Koch institute: true extent of the horrors (true lab \- undertale type of feel)
  - You‚Äôre frequently switching between past & present/ratpocalypse (perhaps it‚Äôs bc of an item you bought from the stata shop)
  - If you‚Äôre in the past, there are rat cages everywhere & you can choose to save or exterminate them (exterminating may give you an xp boost?, but either way saving will cost a key per save that you have to buy from stata shop)
  - In the present you‚Äôre just fighting superrats
  - You have to get through koch institute to get to EC
- EC: final boss \>:0
  - See dead body of cat that protected you üò≠ bc of butterfly effect (your actions to save/kill rats in the past led to admin finding cats annoying and targeting them)
  - Admin going after you, send rats
  - Fight rats
  - If you saved enough, you can convince the rats to join your side and together you fight against admin instead
  - EC gets torn down so that‚Äôs why renovations
- Endings
  - If you saved humans ‚Üí no more rats
    - Admin is really pissed and tries to eliminate you, but you time skip back to the present into Random where you started. Except now there are humans, and random is no longer a cat dorm. The students kick you out or something idk
  - If you saved rats
    - The students/people who were not on board with the rat experiments take over the institute and everything becomes good yippee

Things we didn‚Äôt add:

- Curing the rats (instead of ‚Äúsaving‚Äù)
