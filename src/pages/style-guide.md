# style guide
This page is a compilation of guidelines and tips for maintaining a consistent artstyle in GDG's team projects. This style guide is currently focused on our WIP pixel art game, but will be updated as more projects are made!

## tips for pixel art
- **Use a limited color palette.** Too many colors in one sprite can make it look muddy, uncannily smooth, and inconsistent. There is no set limit for a palette size, but generally more than 16 colors for a single sprite is too many. You can use Aseprite's palette feature to track your colors and `Shift + R` to replace all instances of a color in a sprite.

- **Lighter colors should have a hue closer to red, lower saturation, and higher value/brightness.** The inverse is true for darker colors (their hue should be closer to violet). This method of generating a palette isn't always what a sprite needs, but generally leads to warmer and more natural colors.

- **Use outlines to shape silhouettes.** Although the outline of a sprite should generally cover the entire sprite (except the bottom), adding or omitting some pixels is useful for suggesting pointy-ness or roundness.
